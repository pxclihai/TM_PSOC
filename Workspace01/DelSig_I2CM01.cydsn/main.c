* Version: 1.0
*
* Description:
*  This is source code for Example Project: 8-ch DelSig ADC with I2C Master.
*
* Parameters used:
*  I2C Master
*   Implementation        Fixed function
*   Data rate            100kbps
*   SDA SCL pin config  Open drain, drives low
*   Pull-up resistors    2.67k each
*
*  Delta Sigma ADC
*      Conversion mode     1-Multi Sample
*    Resolution            16 bits
*    Conversion Rate        5000 SPS
*    Input mode            Differential
*
*  IDAC
*    Polarity            Positive
*    Range                0-31.875 uA
*    Speed                Slow
*    Current output        10 uA
*
*  Sequencing Max
*    Mux type            Differential
*    Channels            8
*
* In this project, data converted by the 8-channel, sequenced ADC is sent via
* a I2C Master. The project is tested with a separate project containing a I2C
* slave. The data output by the ADC is made visible on an Character LCD. This
* can be used to verify the data received by the I2C slave which is also
* displayed on an LCD screen.
